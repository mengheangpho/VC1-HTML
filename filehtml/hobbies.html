                    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>For a student, a hobby would mean taking some time off from classes and utilizing it for something that he likes to do. A hobby should come to you naturally. It should not be enforced by anyone. If it has to be enforced upon you then, you will soon lose interest in it. The main purpose of a hobby would be lost.</p>
                   <p>It has been rightly said that regular studies are like a minute speck of information in a vast galaxy of knowledge. There are plenty of things to learn out there. We just need the right mindset for it. A hobby is a great way to incorporate a vast subject of learning into our daily lives. The best thing about hobbies is that they are flexible. They don’t have any strict guidelines to follow. They don’t demand us to do them every day.</p>
                   <p id="none">A regular hobby like reading books can be picked up anytime and anywhere. However, highly skilled hobbies like coding require much more time and skills. You can take professional help if you feel that you don’t have access to enough resources that would further your level of learning. After graduating, when people go out looking for jobs, their hobbies help them to bag jobs. Most of the top recruiters have been demanding to know about our hobbies. So, that they will get a better idea about our personalities.</p>
                   <p id="none">Our hobbies reflect our personalities. The things we choose to do, tell a lot about what kind of people we are. You might be excelling in academics, but if you don’t have a proper hobby that you have been following since a young age. Then you won’t be showcasing any solid personality. Therefore, it is imperative to choose an area of interest and devote some time to it in order to develop as a wholesome individual.</p>

                        <p >Drawing is my favorite hobby. I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my mother who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist. You just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing. </p>
